# Agent Check: RethinkDB

## Overview

[RethinkDB][1] is a distributed documented-oriented NoSQL database, with first class support for realtime change feeds.

This check monitors a RethinkDB cluster through the Datadog Agent and collects metrics about performance, data availability, cluster configuration, and more.

**NOTE**: this integration is compatible with RethinkDB **version 2.3.6 and above**.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][2] for guidance on applying these instructions.

### Installation

The RethinkDB check is included in the [Datadog Agent][3] package. No additional installation is needed on your server.

### Configuration

1. Add a `datadog-agent` user with read-only permissions on the `rethinkdb` database. Use the following ReQL commands, referring to [Permissions and user accounts][4] for details:

    ```python
    r.db('rethinkdb').table('users').insert({'id': 'datadog-agent', 'password': '<PASSWORD>'})
    r.db('rethinkdb').grant('datadog-agent', {'read': True})
    ```

2. Edit the `rethinkdb.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][5]. See the [sample rethinkdb.d/conf.yaml][6] for all available configuration options.

    ```yaml
    init_config:

    instances:
      - host: localhost
        port: 28015
        user: datadog-agent
        password: "<PASSWORD>"
    ```

3. [Restart the Agent][7].

**Note**: this integration collects metrics from all servers in the cluster, so you only need a single Agent.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][8] and look for `rethinkdb` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][9] for a list of metrics provided by this check.

### Service Checks

- `rethinkdb.can_connect`: Returns `CRITICAL` if the Agent cannot reach the configured RethinkDB server, `OK` otherwise.
- `rethinkdb.table_status.ready_for_outdated_reads`: Returns `OK` if all shards of a table are ready to accept outdated read queries, `WARNING` otherwise.
- `rethinkdb.table_status.ready_for_reads`: Returns `OK` if all shards of a table are ready to accept read queries, `WARNING` otherwise.
- `rethinkdb.table_status.ready_for_writes`: Returns `OK` if all shards of a table are ready to accept write queries, `WARNING` otherwise.
- `rethinkdb.table_status.all_replicas_ready`: Returns `OK` if all replicas are ready for reads and writes, `WARNING` otherwise (e.g. if backfills are in progress).

### Events

RethinkDB does not include any events.
